Interview-Practice-Problems
===========================

Practice problems for interviews

This repository will have all of my exercises that I use when practicing for technical interviews. Some of the problems types will include:

-- String processing

-- Data Structure Implementation i.e. Singlely and Doubly Linked List

-- Problem solving techniques like Divide and Conquer, and Recursive Backtracking

-- Graphs -- implementaions and classical problems like BFS, DFS, SSSP.



Languages of problem sets will be in either C++, Java, or Python.

I will have this done by end of Summer 2014.
